Question 1: What is Pandas, and why is it commonly used in data cleaning tasks?
Answer : Panda is a python library.Pandas is the most widely used tool for data managing it contains high data managing,high data structure and manipulation 
         tools designed to make data analysis fast and easy extracting value from pandas.
         it commonly used in data cleaning tasks are :
         1-Data Handling
         2-Missing Data Handling
         3-Data Transformation
         4-Data Manipulation
         5-Time Series Analysis
         6-Integration with Other Libraries

Question 2: Given a DataFrame with missing values, how would you check for missing values in each column and count the total number of missing values? 
Answer : isnull().sum() function detect missing values in the given object.

Question 3: How can you remove duplicates from a DataFrame while retaining the first occurrence of each unique row? 
Answer : Remove duplicates from a DataFrame while retaining the first occurrence of each unique row using the drop_duplicates() method.

Question 4: If you have a DataFrame with a column containing string values, how can you convert all the values in that column to lowercase?
Answer : The values in a column to lowercase using the str.lower() method.
 
Question 5: How do you replace missing values in a DataFrame with a specific value, like 0, for a particular column? 
Answer : Replace missing values in a DataFrame with a specific value, such as 0, for a particular column using the fillna() method. 

Question 6: If you have a DataFrame with a datetime column, how can you extract the year, month, and day into separate columns? 
Answer : DataFrame with the column of Datetime values and use the pd. to_datetime() function to convert this column into a datetime column and finally, 
         use the strftime() method to extract the month and year from a datetime column.

Question 7: How can you filter rows in a DataFrame where a specific column's values meet a certain condition (e.g., all rows where 'age' is greater than 30)? 
Answer : The most common way to filter a data frame according to the values of a single column is by using a comparison operator. A comparison operator evaluates 
         therelationship between two operands (a and b) and returns True or False depending on whether or not the condition is met.
         For example:- df['Age'] > 30 creates a boolean mask indicating True for rows where the 'Age' column values are greater than 30 and False otherwise. 
                       This mask is used to index the DataFrame df, returning a new DataFrame filtered_df containing only the rows where the condition 
                       'Age' > 30 is True.

Question 8: What is the purpose of the .apply() function in Pandas, and how would you use it to create a new column based on values from existing columns?
Answer : Using apply() method.
 
Question 9: Suppose you want to merge two DataFrames, 'df1' and 'df2,' on a common column 'key.' How would you perform this merge operation in Pandas? 
Answer : Merging two DataFrames based on a common column can be done using the pd.merge() function.To merge 'df1' and 'df2' on a common column 'key'.
         for Example :-  merge1 = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='key', how='inner')

Question 10: You have a DataFrame with a column containing messy text data. How can you clean and standardize the text data (e.g., remove punctuation and convert
             to lowercase) in that column? 
Answer : The clean_text() function uses translate() along with str.maketrans() to remove punctuation using Python's string.punctuation,it then converts the text to 
         lowercase using the lower() method.
